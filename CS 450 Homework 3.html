<p>This assignment uses the functional aspects of Scheme to construct a
relatively simple but non-trivial program.  Once you have finished this
assignment you will have a good command of the functional style.</p>

<p>I will collect two files from your <tt>hw3</tt>  directory:
</p><ul>
<li><tt>convert.scm</tt>
</li><li><tt>notes.txt</tt>
</li></ul>
whose contents I describe below.<p></p>

<p>In contrast to the last two assignments, this assignment is much larger and
will take much more time, spread over many days.  It is not an assignment that
you can just jump into and do, and it is not something you can leave for the
weekend.  There is some serious thinking involved.  Please read everything
carefully before you do anything else.  In fact, read it more than once.  It
will save you a lot of time, and you will understand this whole area much
better.</p>

<b>
Transforming Units
</b>
</center>

<p>You may know that Google has a wonderful facility for converting units.  For
instance, suppose you are cooking and you forget how many teaspoons are in a
cup.  You can simple type "1 cup in teaspoons" into the Google search window,
and the answer will come up.  And you can even perform more complicated (or
silly, depending on how you look at it) queries.  For instance, if you haven't
already done this—it's a pretty well-known way to amaze your
friends—try typing
</p><pre>   furlongs per fortnight in miles per hour
</pre>

into the Google search box.  And you can also type things like

<pre>   27.5 furlongs per fortnight in miles per hour
</pre>

In this assignment you are going to write a program that does more or less the
same thing.<p></p>

<p>Before we get going, I should say that there are a number of such programs
available on the web.  I don't believe that any of them are written in Scheme.
And further, I don't believe that looking at them is going to help you.  (I know
this because when I started to do this, that's exactly what I did, and I finally
realized that it was getting me nowhere.)  On the other hand, I am going to give
you some fairly significant suggestions, which I hope will help you a lot in
doing this.  (And as usual, the work you hand in must be entirely your own in
any case.)</p><p>

</p><p>We are not going to write a complete converter program.  That would be too
much for an assignment like this.  But if we did, it would have three parts:</p>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Input:</b>  take a phrase, and turn it into some internal
  representation of what is being asked for.  This is a very complex
  undertaking.  For instance, the program has to be able to recognize plurals
  ("meters" vs. "meter", for instance) and common prefixes ("kilo-", "centi-",
  and so on).  This takes up the bulk of most of these programs from what I can
  see.  It's an interesting problem, but it's not the problem we really care
  about here.</li>

  <li> <b>Processing:</b> Take the "from" quantity (e.g., "27.5 furlongs per
  fortnight", only written in our internal format) and our "to" quantity (e.g.,
  "miles per hour", again written in our internal format) and perform the
  translation.  This is what we are going to do.  In our case, the format of the
  "from" quantity will be
  <pre>     (27.5 (furlong 1)(fortnight -1))
  </pre>
  and the format of the "to" quantity will be
  <pre>     ((mi 1)(hr -1))
  </pre>
  and the actual query will be written as a Scheme function taking these two
  arguments, like this:
  <pre>     (convert '(27.5 (furlong 1)(fortnight -1)) '((mi 1)(hr -1)))
  </pre>
  Question:  why are the quotes necessary?
  </li>

  <li> <b>Output:</b> The value of the expression we just wrote will be

  <pre>     (0.01023065476190476 (mi 1)(hr -1))
  </pre>

  A user-friendly procedure would put this back into everyday English.  But
  we're not going to worry about that.  We'll just leave it as is.</li>
</ol>

<p>But we are not going to do all this:</p>

<p>We are going to cut out the Input and Output parts of the program completely and
only implement the Processing part.  We do this by insisting that the user pass
in the query in a very formalized manner—essentially, in the internal
representation that we will be using.  This makes the program we will write much
less user-friendly, but also makes it possible for us to do this as a homework
assignment.  And in any case, what we produce here could be used as the central
component of a fancier program.  (First build a "front end" that takes in
ordinary English queries as above and translates them into the form we will use
here; then just pass those translated forms into the program of this
assignment.)</p>

<center>
<b>
The Important Question
</b>
</center>

<p>How does the program know how to perform the transformations?  Equivalently,
how does it know how different units are related?  The answer is that it gets
this information from a file that it reads in.  That file is named
<tt>units.dat</tt>.  I have created this file for you, and you can find it in
~offner/cs450/hw3/units.dat.  It is a plain text file.  You should look at
it and see how it is constructed.  Copy it into your hw3 directory.  And
<b>don't change it in any way</b>.

</p><p> One thing you will notice is that it is very simple indeed.  All units are
defined in terms of certain "elementary" or "base" units.  (And an elementary
unit, for this purpose, is a unit that is not defined in terms of another unit
in the <tt>units.dat</tt> file.)  All length units, for instance are represented
in terms of meters.  Now it would be actually more convenient in constructing
this file to allow it to contain entries in which some units were defined in
terms of other derived units, like this:

</p><pre>     (yd (3 (ft 1)))
</pre>
But this would complicate our processing, and so we won't do it.<p></p>

<p>We have not discussed how to read in a file to a Scheme program.  We
<em>will</em> deal with this later in the term.  But in the meantime, here's
how you do it:  At the end of your file <tt>convert.scm</tt> put the following
code:

</p><pre>------------------------
;; read-file produces a list whose elements are the expressions in the file.

(define (read-file)
  (let ((expr (read)))
    (if (eof-object? expr)
        '()
        (cons expr (read-file)))))

;; Here we go:  read in the database.

(define source (with-input-from-file "units.dat" read-file))
------------------------
</pre>

This will read in the file <tt>units.dat</tt> and put the contents as a Scheme
list into the variable <tt>source</tt>.  Then you can just use that list as a
lookup table.  (How do you look up things in that table?  Think about
<tt>assoc</tt>.)<p></p>

<p>To make things as clear as possible, let us make some definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li> A <em>base-unit</em> is something like <tt>m</tt> (i.e., "meter"), or
  <tt>sec</tt> (i.e., "second").</li>

  <li> A <em>unit</em> is a list consisting of a <tt>base-unit</tt> together
  with an exponent.  For instance, the <tt>unit</tt>
  <pre>     (m 2)
  </pre>
  represents "meters squared", or "square meters"—these mean the same
  thing.</li>

  <li> A <em>unit-list</em> is a list of <tt>unit</tt>s.  For instance,
  <pre>     ((mi 1)(hr -1))
  </pre>
  represents "miles per hour".  And
  <pre>     ((kg 1)(m 1)(sec -2))
  </pre>
  represents "kilogram meters per second squared".</li>

  <li> A <em>quantity</em> is a list whose first element is a number and the
  rest of whose elements are units.  That is, the <tt>cdr</tt> of a
  <em>quantity</em> is a <em>unit-list</em>.  For example,

  <pre>     (1 (kg 1)(m 1)(sec -2))
  </pre>
  represents "1 kilogram meter per second squared", which is also known as "1
  newton", and is the unit of force in the MKS ("meter-kilogram-second")
  system that I hope you are familiar with from whatever physics course you
  took.</li>

  <li> Finally, the procedure we are going to write is named "convert", and it
  has the following signature:

  <pre>     (convert <em>&lt;quantity&gt;</em> <em>&lt;unit-list&gt;</em>)
  </pre>

  I've already shown you what the output looks like (i.e., the kind of Scheme
  expression this expression evaluates to) above.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now here are some ideas that you may find useful.  Of course you can really do
this any way you want, and I certainly don't insist that you take any of these
ideas exactly as I am writing them.  (In the past I have found that students
often have very original and interesting ideas about how to solve particular
problems, and so I encourage you to experiment with different ways of doing
things.)</p>

<p>First of all, let's look at the general idea of what you want to do.
Conceptually, it's really pretty simple.  You are given a
<em>quantity</em>—say it is of the form

</p><pre>   (a U)
</pre>

where <tt>a</tt> is a number and <tt>U</tt> is the sequence of <em>units</em> in
a <em>unit-list</em>.  For instance, <tt>U</tt> might be <tt>(mi 1)(hr -2)</tt>.
And suppose you want to convert this original quantity to a quantity whose
sequence of units is <tt>V</tt>; i.e., a quantity whose
<em>unit-list</em> is <tt>(V)</tt>.<p></p>

<p>The first thing you have to check is that <tt>U</tt> is compatible with
<tt>V</tt>.  What this really means is that if you express both <tt>U</tt> and
<tt>V</tt> in terms of the same elementary units, then <tt>U</tt> turns out to
be a constant multiple of <tt>V</tt>.  So the first thing you need to do is to
transform <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> so they are expressed in terms of the same
elementary units.  You will need a procedure that does this.  As already
specified above, you may assume that if a base-unit is not found by your lookup
procedure, then it is already an elementary base-unit (like m, or sec, for
instance).</p>

<p>Applying the procedure, you will then get
</p><pre>   U = u U-normalized

   V = v V-normalized
</pre>
where <tt>U-normalized</tt> and <tt>V-normalized</tt> are written in elementary
units, and where <tt>u</tt> and <tt>v</tt> are numbers.<p></p>

<p>Now <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> are compatible if and only iff
<tt>U-normalized</tt> is the same as <tt>V-normalized</tt>.  So you will need a
procedure to check this.  And somewhere along the way, you will need to take
account of the fact that the order of base-units doesn't matter.  For instance,
<tt>(m 1)(sec -2)</tt> is entirely equivalent to <tt>(sec -2)(m 1)</tt>, or even
to <tt> (sec -1)(m 2)(sec -1)(m -1)</tt>.</p>

<p>Assuming then that <tt>U</tt> and <tt>V</tt> are compatible, you should be
able to see that

</p><pre>   U = (u/v) V
</pre>

In fact, I want to you show this in your <tt>notes.txt</tt> discussion.<p></p>

<p>Finally then, we get

</p><pre>   a U = (au/v) V
</pre>

So that's what you have to do.<p></p>

<p>You will need a number of helper functions to do this.  Give them useful
names that will help you (and me and the grader and anyone else who needs to
read your code—you might want to come back and look at this code a year
from now, for example) understand what you are doing.  And comment them so it is
clear what sorts of things they take as input and what they produce when
evaluated.  Usually giving a good example of how the function is called and what
it returns is the way to go when doing this.  Further, comments inside the
function body can be very helpful in understanding tricky code.  Code is not
easy to read.  Make it easy for the reader; and remember that <em>you</em> might
be the reader.</p>

<p>You will also probably need a large number of temporary variables.  Don't be
afraid of the <tt>let</tt> special form.  And you may find yourself nesting
them, like this:

</p><pre>   (let ((x ...)
         (y ...))
     (let ((z <em>&lt;something involving </em><tt>x</tt><em>&gt;</em>))
       ...
</pre>

and this nesting might even be rather deep.  Don't be afraid of this either.
But <em>do</em> give your temporary variables descriptive names like
<tt>first-unit</tt> or <tt>converted-ratio</tt> (not names like <tt>x</tt> or
<tt>y</tt>, as I did above).  This is important.  The grader and I will be
looking for this.<p></p>

<p>Be sure to test your procedure.  Make up some miserably hard tests.  Remember
that a quantity could look like this:
</p><pre>   (5 (joule 2)(N -3)(hr 1))
</pre>
Although this makes little sense physically, your procedure should handle it
just fine.  Testing is hard.  Try to be as nasty and malicious as possible in
the tests you write.  That's what software engineeers have to do.  Don't ever
assume that "no one would ever input something like ...".  Believe me, someone will.<p></p>

<p>To handle complex quantities like this, you will need to find a way of
simplifying them.  This is part of the process—described above—of
representing quantities in terms of elementary units.  Be careful about this.
It's possible to get confused here.  Write down carefully how you are
approaching this problem.  Make sure you have put in some meaningful comments
for this.</p>

<b>
What you should not do
</b>
</center>

<ul>

  <li><p>I mentioned above how to recognise base units in the <tt>units.dat</tt>
  file.  And I also said you should not alter that file in any way.  So you
  might think that you could just look at the <tt>units.dat</tt> file and make
  your own list of base units and include that list in your code directly.</p>

  <p><b>Don't do this.</b> Although you should not modify the <tt>units.dat</tt>
  file yourself, I might use a different one when I am testing your code.  And
  that one of course might have a different set of base units. So please be
  careful about this.</p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Please only use material we have covered in class up through Wednesday,
  September 22.  In particular, <font color="red"><bf>do not use any non-functional forms such as
  <tt>set!</tt></bf></font>.  I'm serious about this.  If there is even one such form in your
  code, I won't look at it.</p>

  <p>This is for two reasons:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li> This point of this assignment is to become fluent in the functional
    programming style.</li>

    <li> In any case, this problem lends itself admirably to a functional
    solution.  I have seen students try to use other techniques.  Their code was
    not well written and generally didn't work.  I think you will be amazed at how
    well the functional programming style works on problems such as this.
    </li>
  </ol>

</li></ul>

</div>

<center>
<b>
The file <tt>notes.txt</tt>
</b>
</center>

<p>Finally, I am going to take your <tt>notes.txt</tt> file very seriously.
First, please make sure you answer in your <tt>notes.txt</tt> file the questions
I wrote above.  However, if that is all you write about, I will not be very
impressed.  In addition to that, I want to know what problems you encountered as
you did this assignment.  What was easy?  What took some thinking?  What
mistakes did you make, and how did you fix them?  Would you do things
differently a second time?  And if you had more time, how would you extend this
code to make it more useful and/or user-friendly?  (I'm not looking for vague
ideas here.  If you have an idea, let me know how you would implement it.  Don't
write actual code, though.)</p>
    
<p>If you leave writing your <tt>notes.txt</tt> file until you have finished
your coding, you most likely won't do a very good job.  For one thing, you will
have forgotten a lot.  For another thing, you will probably be jammed for time.
A better idea is to keep some sort of "diary" as you write your code.  Then you
can turn your diary into the essay in <tt>notes.txt</tt></p>

<p><b>However:</b> I don't want your <tt>notes.txt</tt> to be a bunch of raw
unedited notes.  I want it to be thoughtful and easy to read.</p>

<p>I also don't want to see big long listings of test runs.  I do want you to
indicate to me how you tested your code.  (For instance, what sort of tests did
you run?  What were you looking for?)  But please don't give me all the gory
details.</p>

<p>Often I find students who think that they are writing <tt>notes.txt</tt> for
me, and they figure that I already know all this.  So they write very little,
assuming that I can fill what they haven't written.  There are two things wrong
with this:

</p><ol>

  <li> I'm not a mind-reader.  While it may seem strange to you, I usually don't
  know what is going on in your mind, or how you got to understand something.
  And I'm not good at guessing that sort of thing.  You have to tell me.  I mean
  this.  It's true.</li>

  <li>In any case, you want to write this as if you had spent a considerable
  amount of time developing this software.  And now you are going to move to
  another project, and someone who is much less experienced than you has just
  been hired to take this over.  You want to write something that person can
  understand.  Remember that the person doesn't really know very much and is
  just learning about this.  Don't assume that person is an expert.</li>


</ol>
<p></p>

<p>Just as one example of something you might write:  It's perfectly OK, and in
fact, it's good to write things like this:</p>

<font color="blue">
<pre>    At first I thought that

          &lt;XXX&gt;

    But then I found that it led to the following problem:

          &lt;YYY&gt;

    So I changed my design so that

          &lt;ZZZ&gt;
</pre>
</font>

<p>This is good, and I always like to read things like this, because it shows me
how you came to understand the problem.  And furthermore, it will be of great
help to someone who is learning about this for the first time, since they will
probably have the same misunderstandings, and this will help them get through
this process more easily.  And that's the point of writing something like this
up.</p>

<p>In fact, I frequently put comments like that in my own code, because I know
that even if no one else ever looks at it, I myself will probably have to look
at it in a few months, or a few years, and the comment will remind me of where
the tricky difficulty was.</p>
